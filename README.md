_Shell and bash unit testing for the masses_

_provashell_ is a simple bash unit testing library that employs annotations and
is completely self-contained on one file. It should work on most shells as well.


## Getting Started

Usage is relatively straightfoward (using master version):

```Shell
curl -sO 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danigiri/provashell/master/src/main/bash/provashell'
cat > test.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
#@Test
foo1() {
    assertTrue '[ 0 -eq 0 ]'
    assertEq 0 0
    assertEquals foo foo
}

. ./provashell
EOF
chmod a+x test.sh
./test.sh
```


## Motivation

I was looking for an Apache2.0-licensed shell testing library that was 
relatively simple and had no complex dependencies. Could not find anything so I 
just cooked something together. There are of course plenty of great shell 
testing libraries [out there!](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1339416/unit-testing-bash-scripts)


## Installation

There are three ways to get the script:

### The quick n' dirty

Downloading the script itself is enough as _provashell_ has no dependencies.
```Shell
curl -O 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danigiri/provashell/master/src/main/bash/provashell'
```

### Using git

Just clone the repository and you are ready to go, the script itself is in
`src/main/bash/provashell`

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/danigiri/provashell.git
ls -l src/main/bash/provashell
```

### Building a deployable rpm using Maven

This runs _provashell_'s tests and creates a rpm that that installs the script 
on `/opt/provashell/provashell` though the RPM itself is relocatable. The rpm
file can be found at `target/rpm/provashell/RPMS/noarch/provashell`. 
To just run the tests and not build the RPM do `mvn test`.

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/danigiri/provashell.git
mvn package
find target/rpm -name '*.rpm' -exec rpm -ilv -qp '{}' \;
```
This method requires Java and (Apache Maven!)[http://maven.apache.org] to be 
installed, as well as the `rpmbuild` tool (which can be found in the `rpm-build` 
package on CentOS).


##Â Usage

_provashell_ employs annotations to run the tests, preparation and cleanup 
functions. Annotations are like `#@Annotation` without any spaces or tabs before 
the comment or in the annotation itself. The annotation line must come just
before the affected function, with no extra lines in between.

A sample test looks like this:

```Shell
	#!/bin/bash

	#@BeforeScript
	init() {
		echo 'Preparation function: this just runs one time before all tests'
	}

	#@AfterScript
	end() {
		echo 'Cleanup function: this just runs one time after all tests'
	}

	#@Before
	setUp() {
		echo 'Runs before each test'
	}

	#@After
	tearDown() {
		echo 'Runs after each test'
	}

	#@Test
	foo() {
		assertTrue '[ 0 -eq 0 ]'
		assertEq 'Zeroes should be equal' 0 0
	}

	fooNotRunning() {
		assertTrue '[ 0 -eq 0 ]'
	}

	. provashell
``` 


## API Reference

The following annotations are defined:

	#@BeforeScript
Runs the function once before any tests are run
	
	#@AfterScript
Runs the function once after all tests are run
	
	#@Before
Runs the function before each tests is run
	
	#@After
Runs the function after each tests is run
	 
	#@Test
Identifies the function as a test and it is run once by provashell, note that 
test order in the script is respected 	

The following assertions are defined:

	assertTrue ['message'] <'expression expected to be true'>
	
Checks if the expression evaluates to true, otherwise it prints `message` to 
STDERR (or a default one if no message is passed). The expression must be a 
shell test one, usually `test`, `[ ]`, extended test `[[ ]]` in the case of bash
or testable constructs such as `(( ))` or `let`. Therefore, calls such as
`assertTrue "[ -e $file ]"` or `assertTrue 'Message' "test -z '$v'"` are valid
whereas `assertTrue '0 -eq 0' is not. The message cannot be empty so if none is
desired just do not pass any message argument and the default will be used.
	
	assertFalse ['message'] <'expression expected to be false'>
	
Equivalent to `assertTrue` but expecting the expression to evaluate to false.
	
	asserEq ['message'] <expected number> <actual number>
	
Assertion testing the equality of two numbers using the `-eq` test.
	
	assertEquals ['message'] <'expected string'> <'actual string'>
	
Asserting testing the equality of two strings using `==`
	
The following methods are also available:

	startSkippingTests
	
Prevents assertions to be executed. This means that the test expressions 
themselves will not be evaluated at all.

	stopSkippingTests

Behaviour is back to assertions being executed.


### Environment variables

Two environment variables modify the behaviour of _provashell_ if they are 
defined with any value

	export PS_VERBOSE=1

Adds extra diagnostics messages to output. For instance it outputs which
assertions are actually being executed.

	export PS_QUIET=1

Supresses _provashell_'s normal output (for now the end message stating how 
many tests have been ran).


### Function return codes

	0
	
Assertion evaluated as expected (ie. the expression was expected to be true and
it was).

	1

General problem with the test.

	3

Assertion did not evaluate as expected (ie. the expression was expected to be 
true and it evaluated to false).

	4

Incorrect number of parameters passed to the assertion.

	5

The expression passed to the assertion was not a valid expression.
